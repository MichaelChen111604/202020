                Q: What is the 20/20/20 rule?
                <LineBreak/>
                A: The 20/20/20 rule is an easy-to-follow, science-backed tip for keeping your eyes healthy while working at a computer. It's simple: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.

                Q: Why should I use this app?
                <LineBreak/>
                A: 202020 is a 100% free, open-source program that makes the 20/20/20 rule even more convenient! 
                You can adjust timers, notifications, colors, and more from the settings page.

                Q: Why can't I see the 202020 icon when it's running?
                <LineBreak/>
                A: If you have "Run in Taskbar" unchecked in settings (unchecked by default), 202020 runs in the tray. 
                Move your cursor to the bottom right of your window, and when the taskbar pops up, click the '^' symbol. You should see 202020 running here.
                It may also be next to the '^' symbol.

                Q: Is there any way to leave feedback or ask questions?
                <LineBreak/>
                A: For sure! Feel free to email app.202020.2021@gmail.com. All feedback, positive and negative, is greatly appreciated. 
                Suggestions and questions are more than welcome and I'll try to respond promptly if you have any.
